# Faccina

Archive reader

## Usage with Docker Compose

Use `docker-compose.example.yaml` as a base.

- The `content` directory is where the archives are located.
- The `data` directory is where thumbnails and symbolic links to the content are saved.
- `CDN_URL` is the public URL of the server where images are loaded from.
